# TODO
## ACTION ITEMS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE WITH DEADLINES

### BY AUGUST 24TH
- [ ] Footer should contain only links to "Archive" and "Subscribe"
> Archive is a link to another webpage, 
> onClick subscribe we trigger a text box to appear
> this text box has "email address" in gray (perhaps semi-transparent) italics
- [ ] Archive page _see files_  <sup>a little more detail here would be great</sup>

### BY AUGUST 28TH
- [ ] Create animation such that archive link at the bottom of page shakes when tapped <sup>need a little more specificity on this interaction</sup>
- [ ] Replace ugly house icon with simple text <sup>what style?</sup> that simply reads "Home" 
- [ ] CSS aesthetic tweaking/small changes (font, svg, spacing etc â€” tbd in more detail in the future_
    
    
 #### NOTE:
_WE DO NOT NEED AN ARCHIVE MODE/STATE BY THE END OF AUGUST BUT ALL OTHER SMALL CHANGES ARE A NECESSITY BEFORE THE 28TH IF POSSIBLE_
