# TODO
> UPCOMING ACTION ITEMS IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
> WITH SOLID DEADLINES
> AND EXACT, SPECIFIC CHANGES

## BY AUGUST 28TH
### FOOTER CHANGES
**- [ ] Footer should contain only links to "Archive" and "Subscribe"**
> Archive is a link to another webpage, 
> onClick subscribe we trigger a text field to appear
        > this text box has "email address" in gray (perhaps semi-transparent) italics

#### TEXT CHANGES
- [ ] Make the body text ALL garamond


#### LAYOUT CHANGES
- [ ] Add SVGs instead of text for V1 V2 V3
- [ ] Create a "post" template page laid out in a similar manner as IMG_0243 in the wireframes folder
- etc
- [ ] Replace ugly house icon with simple text <sup>what style?</sup> that simply reads "Home"
- [ ] Create animation such that archive link at the bottom of page shakes when tapped <sup>need a little more specificity on this interaction</sup> 

#### Revision once currently requested changes are pushed  
- [ ] CSS aesthetic tweaking/small changes (font, svg, spacing etc â€” tbd in more detail in the future)
- [ ] reconsider "Archive" and "Subscribe" link animation
- [ ] make posting guide non coders     
    
 #### NOTE .<sup>WE DO NOT NEED AN ARCHIVE MODE/STATE BY THE END OF AUGUST BUT ALL OTHER SMALL CHANGES ARE A NECESSITY BEFORE THE 28TH IF POSSIBLE</sup>
